# IRC

Final project for CS494 - Internet Relay Chat (Socket programming done on Python)

> Simple chat that allows client to create user and interact with other users, as well as create/join room to exchange messages with multiple users.

---

## Run

Simply run `python3 main.py`

---

## Specs

> **NOTE**: Server saves all the user and room information until it is shutdown. At the restart clients will need to create new user accounts and new rooms (all previous information will NOT be saved). Once server is started, it keeps waiting for new user connections, until user interrupt occurs (`ctrl+c`).
